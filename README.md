This repository contains my course assignment for the HTML and CSS course in the first semester of Frontend Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## About:

This project is a representation of the design I created for the course assignment at the end of the Design course, during the first semester. The primary focus of this assignment was to build a responsive website from scratch using only HTML and CSS, without the use of a CSS framework.

## Features
The page consists of 8 pages:
  * Home
  * Movie Catagory page
  * Singel Movie detail page
  * Cart
  * Checkout
  * Checkout success
  * Contact page
  * About page
  * Signup and Log in page

## Process:
The project was executed following a structured process:

**Asset Preparation:** All design assets were exported from Figma, converted to webp format, and resized to comply with the 200kb limit mentioned in the assignment criteria.

**GitHub Repository Setup:** A GitHub repository was created, and issues were added to track the development of individual pages and sections.

**HTML and CSS Creation:** HTML files were created for each page and linked with corresponding stylesheets. External resources such as FontAwesome and Google Fonts were included.On the project create folder named CSS, Images and Video for diffrent types of assets.

**Responsive Design:** As the initial design was desktop-only, mobile-first prototypes were created in Figma to plan out the mobile version. Pages were then built from scratch, following a mobile-first approach, and styles and media queries were added to make the pages responsive.

**Bug Fixing:** After completing the initial versions of the pages, time was dedicated to polish, fix bugs, and ensure a seamless user experience. I checked the code with W3C's markup validation service

**Deployment:** The project was deployed on Vercel.
